# Estimating behavioural relaxation induced by COVID-19 vaccines in the first months of their rollout
Data and code for the paper "Estimating behavioural relaxation induced by COVID-19 vaccines in the first months of their rollout".
# Abstract
The initial rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has been challenged by logistical issues, limited availability of doses, scarce healthcare capacity, spotty acceptance, and variants of concern. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been critical to support these phases. However, vaccines may have prompted behavioural relaxation, potentially reducing NPIs adherence. Epidemic models have explored this phenomenon, but they have not been validated against data. Moreover, recent surveys provide conflicting results on the matter. The extent of behavioural relaxation induced by COVID-19 vaccines is still unclear. Here, we aim to study this phenomenon in four regions. We implement five realistic epidemic models which include age structure, multiple virus strains, NPIs, and vaccinations. One of the models acts as a baseline, while the others extend it including different behavioural relaxation mechanisms. First, we calibrate the baseline model and run counterfactual scenarios to quantify the impact of vaccinations and NPIs. Our results confirm the critical role of both in reducing infection and mortality rates. Second, we calibrate the behavioural models and compare them to each other and to the baseline using different metrics. Including behavioural relaxation leads to a better fit of weekly deaths in three regions. However, the improvements are limited to a $2-10\%$ reduction in weighted mean absolute percentage errors and these gains are generally offset by models' increased complexity. Overall, we do not find clear signs of behavioural relaxation induced by COVID-19 vaccines on weekly deaths. Furthermore, our results suggest that if this phenomenon occurred, it generally involved only a firm minority of the population. Our work contributes to the retrospective validation of epidemic models developed amid the COVID-19 Pandemic and underscores the issue of non-identifiability of complex social mechanisms.
## Data
The data folder contains raw data (in the sub-folder `demographic raw`, `epidemic raw`, `mobility raw`), and processed data (in the sub-folder `regions`) that are used for running calibration and simulation for the four regions.
## Calibration
The calibration folder contains the codes for model calibration. We have 6 scripts for different models (the name starting with baseline (for baseline model), behaviour (for model 1 and 2), variation (for model 3 and 4)) and the other scripts are for running calibration for different regions and models.
## Simulation
The simulation folder contains the codes for running counterfactual scenarios and other simulations.
## Posteriors
The posteriors folder contains the posteriors of the four regions. CSV files are the sampled parameters and NPZ files are the sampled trajectories.
## Model_output
The model_output folder contains the results (trajectories) of counterfactual scenarios (labelled with 'no') and the original model (labelled with 'yes').
## Script_for_plots
The script_for_plots contains the scripts for generating plots in the paper.
